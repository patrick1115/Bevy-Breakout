### General Information
 * More information will be added in describing aspects of the project.

  * I chose not to include the collision-sounds since running the game with sound intially caused my computer to lag. It would be relatively easy to implement a sound into the 'collisions' function, although some aspects of the game I though would be easy proved to be more troublesome. 
  
### Future Add-ons
  * All in all, I enjoyed this class. I wished I was more active when debugging, such as asking about the score update error. However, it also allowed me to be more creative and change my inital approach of the game - adding a game menu and start/pause screen. 
      
  * I was able to focus more on customizing my game, which in turn helped set me up for more complex additions to the game I can add in my free time.  
   
  Focusing more on:

    > Sprite, Mesh, and Text Bundles
    
    > Timers and implementing functionalities for certain type (Scoreboard, Walls) 
    
    > Event Handling 
    
    > rand crate (and some I ended up not using but learning about - rapier, quickmenu, bevy-ui-navigation)
